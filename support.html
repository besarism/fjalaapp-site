                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I unlock all letters?</h3>
                        <p>The letter A is available for free so you can try the app. To unlock all 36 Albanian letters and access all features, you can subscribe to the full version for $4.99/month. We offer a 3-day free trial so you can explore everything before committing. Subscribe through the app's parent section by tapping "Unlock All Letters."</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What age is this app designed for?</h3>
                        <p>Fjala is designed for children ages 3-8 years old. The app is particularly helpful for preschool and early elementary students who are beginning to learn the Albanian alphabet. The interface is simple enough for young children to navigate independently, while the content is engaging enough to keep older learners interested.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is only letter A free?</h3>
                        <p>We offer letter A for free so families can try the app and see if it's a good fit for their child before subscribing. This gives you a complete experience of the tracing exercises, pronunciation guides, and games without any commitment. If your child enjoys learning letter A, they'll love the full alphabet! The subscription helps us continue developing new features and maintaining the app.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How does the parent section work?</h3>
                        <p>The parent section is protected by a simple math problem to prevent children from accidentally accessing it. Inside, you can view your child's progress, see which letters they've completed, manage subscriptions, and adjust settings. To access it, tap the lock icon on the main menu and solve the verification problem.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is an internet connection required?</h3>
                        <p>No! Once you've downloaded the app and completed the initial setup, Fjala works completely offline. This makes it perfect for car rides, airplane trips, or anywhere without reliable internet. You only need internet for the initial download, subscription management, and optional progress backup.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
                        <p>Fjala is available for both iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android devices. For iOS, you need version 14.0 or later. For Android, you need version 8.0 (Oreo) or later. The app works great on tablets, which provide a larger screen for tracing exercises.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
                        <p><strong>For iOS (iPhone/iPad):</strong><br>
                        1. Open the Settings app<br>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">You'll continue to have access until the end of your current billing period. Your child's progress will be saved locally on the device.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>My child is struggling with tracing. Any tips?</h3>
                        <p>Here are some helpful tips:<br>
                        • <strong>Start slow:</strong> Encourage your child to trace slowly and carefully rather than quickly<br>
                        • <strong>Use a finger or stylus:</strong> A capacitive stylus can provide better control than a finger<br>
                        • <strong>Proper posture:</strong> Make sure the device is on a stable surface and your child is sitting comfortably<br>
                        • <strong>Practice together:</strong> Trace letters alongside your child to demonstrate proper technique<br>
                        • <strong>Celebrate effort:</strong> Praise attempts even if they're not perfect - improvement comes with practice<br>
                        • <strong>Take breaks:</strong> Short, focused sessions are better than long frustrated ones<br>
                        • <strong>Start with easier letters:</strong> Letters like I, L, and O are simpler to trace than Gj, Xh, or Zh</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can multiple children use the app?</h3>
                        <p>Currently, each installation of Fjala is designed for one child's learning journey. If you have multiple children, they can share one profile, but their progress will be combined. We're working on a multi-child feature for future updates! Each child can use the app on different devices with separate subscriptions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is this Gheg or Tosk dialect?</h3>
                        <p>Fjala uses Standard Albanian pronunciation, which is based primarily on the Tosk dialect as it's the official standard. However, we're working on adding a Gheg pronunciation option in a future update so families can choose the dialect that matches their heritage. The alphabet and letters themselves remain the same across both dialects.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will there be more content added?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! We're continuously working on new features and content, including:<br>
                        • More games and activities<br>
                        • Simple word building exercises<br>
